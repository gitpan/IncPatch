IncPatch 0.02

IncPatch lets you incrementally apply one or more diffs. For example, you may
have a diff that implements two separate features, and you only want one of
them. You could manually chop the diff up into two, but that is tedious and
potentially error-prone -- are you sure you got the headers right?

Thankfully people are starting to take version control very seriously, so diff
and patch are being ushered to the backstage. But they're still important! I
use IncPatch to help manage many small but incomplete changes to large
codebases. `svk diff > misc.diff`, `svk revert --recursive .`, then I can
pull in any little changes from misc.diff that I want with IncPatch without
them getting in the way of every commit.

The interface is very similar to that of darcs record, because if you're
going to imitate, you might as well imitate the best of them.
