IncPatch 0.01

IncPatch lets you incrementally apply one or more diffs. For example, you may
have a diff that implements two separate features, and you only want one of
them. You could manually chop the diff up into two, but that is tedious and
potentially error-prone.

The interface is very very similar to that of darcs record.
